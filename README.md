### Programmer Notes

1. Below, I've outlined the requirements as described in the official note to guide the preparation of the environment and the initiation of the application. 
2. I made extensive changes to this code, improving and refactoring many aspects over the course of two days. However, they won't be evaluating any modifications made to this particular code.
3. My approach to inputting this code, which I've opened and modified on my GitHub, aims to showcase my perspective and restructure it in a more efficient manner.

### App Introduction

The code is an Android app which looks like Wechat Moments page. 

We have some requirements during building this app, and you should also try to follow these requirements:

- The project is an Android app which looks like Wechat Moments page.
- The page consists of profile image, avatar and tweets list
- For each tweet, there will be a sender, optional content, optional images and comments
- A tweet contains from 0 to 9 images
- Pulling down table view to refresh, only first 5 items are shown after refreshing
- All tweets are fetched and stored in memory at the first time and only show first 5 of them at the beginning and after refresh.
- Show 5 more while user pulling up the view at the bottom of the table view.
- Supports layout on all kinds of android device screen and orientation.
- This is a static page.

#### Tech requirements:

- The data JSON will be hosted at localhost:2727
- An example of the response in `Tweet.json`
- Unit tests are appreciated.
- Functional programming is appreciated
- Keep your code clean as much as possible Production and Technical requirements are weighing equally in the final result.
